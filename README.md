# Personal Scoop Bucket

[![Tests](https://github.com/quotidian-ennui/personal-scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/quotidian-ennui/personal-scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Excavator](https://github.com/quotidian-ennui/personal-scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/quotidian-ennui/personal-scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml)


This isn't really that interesting; it's a scoop bucket where I'm keeping things that I've been installing. You're welcome to use it but I'm a scoop newbie, so I'm sure I'm not going to be doing things the _prescribed way_. The tests will probably fail, and I don't even know what excavator even is!
